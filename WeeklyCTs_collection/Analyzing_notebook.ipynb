    "1. Navigation of the folder in which one think there maybe any weeklyCTs. These folders can be on this computer or a user can just make these folders by downloading new patients from MIRADA or other UMCG datasets.\n",

    "2. Extracting only weeklyCTs from these folders and make an excel file from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Transferring the new-founded weeklyCTs into a destination folder (it can be an existing folder for the weeklyCTs or a new folder).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Making a report excel file of some information about the weeklyCTs in the destination file and some clinical information from the patients who have these weeklyCTs.\n",

    "### DICOM Files\n",
    "All kinds of CTs were stored in the form of DICOM files. DICOM, which stands for Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, is a standard for transmitting, storing, and sharing medical images. DICOM files contain information about medical images, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound. This standard ensures the interoperability of medical imaging equipment from different manufacturers. Some key features are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metadata:** DICOM files store not only the pixel data of the medical images but also a wealth of metadata. This metadata includes patient information, imaging device details, acquisition parameters, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interoperability:** DICOM enables the exchange of medical images and related information between different devices and systems. This interoperability is crucial in healthcare settings where various imaging modalities and equipment are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured Data:** DICOM files use a structured format for information, allowing for consistency and ease of interpretation by different systems. This makes it possible for healthcare professionals to access and understand the data regardless of the equipment used to capture or generate the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "For information of different tags and the definitions one can use the following links: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM), [link](https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods)\n"
